``` I appreciate any feedback to improve this project!```

A 42 School project that sorts integers on a stack using a limited set of operations with optimal efficiency.

## Features 🚀
- **Integer Parsing**: Handles both individual arguments and quoted strings
- **Error Handling**: Detects duplicates, non-integer values, and integer overflows
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements efficient sorting for both small (3-5 elements) and large (100-500 elements) stacks
- **Checker Program**: Verifies if instructions actually sort the stack correctly
- **Optimized Operations**: Minimizes moves using combination operations (RR/RR/SS)

## Installation 📦
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzabsst/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```
